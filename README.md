This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

## Transactions Cloud
Application allowing you to observe and highlight specific kinds of transactions.

Select a Transaction Category from the left most table. These have been categorised by the combination of transactionType and the colour associated with the matching rules.

The central part of the UI becomes filled with the matches - the rules that were matched.
 - Hover over any rule, and you will see the count of matched transactions for that rule, displayed in the sidebar.
 - Click on any rule, and you will see the list of matched transactions with IDs and descriptions.

### Development and Tooling

I decided to use this challenge as an opportunity to gain some 'ramp-up' with React.
I have not had experience with React in my career as of yet, and have just dabbled in my spare time.

Unfortunately, this has meant I have not used many other libraries or build tools, as I was really going from 0 to solution.

Testing is also something lacking. Having more time and more experience, I would further get to grips with Jest as a starting point and implement tests to cover each of the components, and the interactions between various parts of the app.

#Thanks for this opportunity!
